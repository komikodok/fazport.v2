            description: 'This machine learning project contains two separate deep learning implementations using TensorFlow: one for image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and another for natural language processing using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Both models demonstrate how neural networks can be applied to visual and textual data respectively, covering essential steps such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.',

            description: 'This project demonstrates how to integrate Firestore with FastAPI, featuring custom serialization and structured exception handling. Built with Python 3.10+ to take advantage of match-case syntax, it allows clean error handling and modular response logic. The custom serializer mimics the behavior of Django REST Framework, providing a structured way to define and validate data models for Firestore operations.\n\nKey features include seamless CRUD operations with Firestore, Pythonic error handling using structural pattern matching, and a reusable serialization system for cleaner and more maintainable code.',
