Beyond simply delivering responses, this bot can adjust its expressions based on the context of the conversation. Powered by advanced LLM (Large Language Model) technology with LangChain-Groq and LangGraph, the chatbot can generate more dynamic and context-aware responses. Built using a combination of FastAPI for backend logic processing and Laravel for handling the UI, Expressive Bot offers an interactive chat experience with an added layer of emotional expression.',

Built with Python 3.10+ to take advantage of match-case syntax, it allows clean error handling and modular response logic. The custom serializer mimics the behavior of Django REST Framework, providing a structured way to define and validate data models for Firestore operations.\n\nKey features include seamless CRUD operations with Firestore, Pythonic error handling using structural pattern matching, and a reusable serialization system for cleaner and more maintainable code.',
